    <title>Welcome to Penny Bryant's Website</title>

    My name is Penny Bryant and I live in St. Charles, MO. I currently work at Lindenwood University as the Director of Student and Academic Support Services. I have two sons, one in Chicago who works for major league soccer, and another in Atlanta who works in sports information for Kennesaw State University. I have no web application experience at all so this will be brand new to me. I hope to gain a greater understanding of coding (I have very limited knowledge) throughout this course. My goal is to set up a website for my fiancé. He is retired, but he and two others rehab houses and don’t currently have a website showcasing their finished products. They have a lot of business, but this would increase their visibility. My favorite hobby is bike riding. My fiancé and I like to explore different trails and usually ride 10-20 miles during the week.
